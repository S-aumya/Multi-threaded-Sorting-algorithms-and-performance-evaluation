# Multi-threaded-Sorting-algorithms-and-performance-evaluation
Multi-threaded Sorting algorithms and performance evaluation :
Insertion Sort, Merge Sort etc
This project is for demonstrating the Multi-threading feature for speeding up
execution. The coding is done using python programming. The timing information
is compared for different sizes of data sets with and without multi-threading for a
number of sorting algorithms. Python Multi-threading features are utilized.
